# Kity üê±‚ú®

> Kity - A small Cathy you can carry around.

Kity is a lightweight Android application inspired by my old project - [Cathy-Electron](https://github.com/nesuwu/Cathy-Electron), designed for quick and easy file uploads primarily to [Catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/). It allows users to upload files, manage an optional userhash for their Catbox account, and keep a history of their uploads.
